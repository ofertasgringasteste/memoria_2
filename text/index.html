            The Brain Song…</p>
            
            <p class="bdfont mar1">Still watching? Still making your decision? Ever since we've released this product, 
            we've got all kinds of interest in the Brain Song with people emailing in and asking questions. 
            So I'm just going to answer a few of the most common questions while you're sitting there 
            deciding to claim your own copy.</p>
            
            <div id="accordion">
                  <h3><span class="qmark">Q1</span> The first question is from Luann Hull in Austin, Texas who asks,<br>
                  <span class="span1">“What makes the Brain Song superior to cardio, brain games or brain supplements?”</span> </h3>
                  <div id="acc-cont">              	
                    <div class="accord-txt">
                        <p class="bdfont">Cardio is great for BDNF but in the studies, people are doing 4-5 hours of 
                        hard cardio a week, every week. Not everyone can stick to that. I don’t myself.<sup>61</sup></p> 

                        <p class="bdfont mar1">Then there’s meditation, chanting and yoga which are great too but 
                        the people in those studies were doing it for 4 hours a day, everyday too.<sup>62</sup> 
                        Most people just don’t have 4 hours a day for this stuff, nor do they need to if they’re 
                        listening to the Brain Song. </p>
                        
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">And the problem with supplements is not just that it’s costing you $50-100 per month, 
                        every month, forever. It’s also that many compounds don’t cross the blood-brain barrier, 
                        so you don’t actually get the benefits.</p> 
                        
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">But what about brain games? Surprisingly, the research shows these brain games do 
                        little to slow mental decline. In fact, the biggest Sudoku study ever found that 
                        Sudoku had no noticeable effect on slowing cognitive decline. It turns out, 
                        the only benefit you get from Sudoku is that you get better at Sudoku.<sup>63</sup> </p>
                        
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">In fact, research shows the best “exercise” for memory is actually learning a 
                        new language.<sup>64</sup>  The cognitive effect of a new language physically changes the 
                        structure of your brain. Try French, Portuguese or even Mandarin. Your friends will be amazed.</p>
                        
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">Customers love the Brain Song because it’s not hours of hard cardio or 
                        time-intensive brain games. It’s only 17 minutes per day. Everyone can find 
                        17 minutes a day to pop on a pair of headphones and relax listening to the 
                        special soundwave. It begins working the very first time you listen to it, 
                        as the special frequency activates your BDNF supporting an improved memory and 
                        sharper mind that gets stronger with age..</p>

                    	<p class="bdfont">Great question. Listening to the Brain Song is simple, 
                        easy and you can do it at-home as soon as today: Just download the Digital Audio Track 
                        to your phone or computer.</p>

                        <p class="bdfont mar1">All the technology is already programmed onto the Track for you, 
                        and will begin activating your BDNF by using the science-backed special frequency.</p>
                        
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">Just relax and listen. After 17 minutes, the audio track will finish and you’ll be done. That’s it.</p>
                        
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">No exercises. No pills. No writing anything down.</p> 
                        
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">You can even listen to it in the car, on a walk, or while you’re shopping, 
                        cooking, reading or just relaxing in the backyard. In fact, research has found both sunlight and 
                        walking are positively linked with more BDNF. So one of my favorite ways to use the Brain Song 
                        is to listen to it while going for a walk when it’s sunny.<sup>65</sup></p>
                        
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">And what if you miss a day? It’s okay, and not the end of the world 
                        if you do. Just aim to listen everyday for those 17 minutes. The benefits increase every time 
                        you listen. And the result is activated BDNF and all the remarkable benefits that come with it. </p>

                        like feeling alert and clear-headed all day, grasping new ideas quickly, even when it takes 
                        others much longer to get it, or improved memory within the first  2 weeks. Some people even say 
                        they feel they have more brain power now than they did 10 or 20 years ago.</p> 
                        
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">Other changes, like learning faster and improved recall, 
                        may happen over time in the coming weeks and months.                        </p>
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">As you listen more each day, the brain grows stronger and new abilities unlock. 
                        You focus easier. You remember more. The right words are now there for you as you need them in conversation.</p> 
                        
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">And even though many of these improvements will happen in the first month, 
                        the benefits will continue as you keep listening for those 17 minutes a day.</p> 
                        
                        <p class="bdfont mar1">After a few months, you might notice you feel like an entirely new person.</p>

                        the markup they required would make the price at least double what it is now for our customers. 
                        All that extra markup makes no sense. It’s just added to subsidize all of their overhead and 
                        advertising costs, as well as put extra profit in their pockets which would be pointless since 
                        you can already order the Brain Song from the comfort of your home directly from this website.</p>

                        <p class="bdfont mar1">I was also concerned they might “water down” the technology we developed and placed in the 
                        Brain Song audio, which cannot be found anywhere else, including on YouTube or Spotify. 
                        In fact, we studied the few tracks offered on those websites and the results were disappointing. 
                        For many of them, there was no special technology embedded in the audio sounds at all.
